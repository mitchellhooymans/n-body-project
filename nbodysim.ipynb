    "# Introduction to n-body Simulations\n",
    "This script is intended to be used as an introduction to making a [n-body simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation) in Python. The notebook uses [newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation) to simulate the motion of n-bodies in a 3D Space. N-body simulations are a powerful tool for investigating the dynamics of systems of particles. A great example of an n-body simulation is the [Millenium Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Run) where the matter distribution of the universe was simulatied over cosmic time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's law of universal gravitation is given by the formula:\n",
    "$$ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $F$ is the force between the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$\n",
    "- $G$ is the gravitational constant\n",
    "- $r$ is the distance between the two masses\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite this formula in its vector form as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F} = -G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{|{\\vec{r}}|^2} \\hat{r} $$\n",
    " or\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F} = -G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{|{\\vec{r}}|^3} \\vec{r} $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\vec{F}$ is the force vector between the masses $m_1$ and $m_2$\n",
    "- $\\vec{r}$ is the vector pointing from $m_1$ to $m_2$\n",
    "- $\\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from $m_1$ to $m_2$\n",
    "- $|{\\vec{r}}|$ is the magnitude of the vector $\\vec{r}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply using F = ma we can find the acceleration of the body due to the force acting on it:\n",
    "$$ \\vec{a} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{m} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is\n",
    "$$ \\vec{a} = -G \\frac{m_2}{|{\\vec{r}}|^3} \\vec{r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use the acceleration to update the position and velocity of the body:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these equations we can compute the force between each body in the simulation, and then use this force to update the position and velocity of each body based on the acceleration. Assuming we are in 3D space we will need to do this for each component of the position and velocity vectors. This is a naive approach to solving the n-body problem, and there are more efficient algorithms that can be used to solve this problem (see [Barnes-Hut simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation), [Particle Mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_mesh)).\n",
